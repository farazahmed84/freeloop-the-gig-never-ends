Find jobs → Compete → Work → Handle stress → Improve → Repeat
Every day is a decision: work, rest, or grow — but burnout is always near.

## 🔁 Daily Loop Flow

1. **Display 3 Random Job Cards**

   * Each includes title, lorem description, required skill + level, and max pay
   * Always at least one job that matches player skill

2. **Job Application Mini-Game** (always triggers on job selection)

   * 3 math questions (MCQs) with standard timer
   * All correct → win the job
   * Any wrong → fail the job (+3 stress, no income)

3. **Skill Challenge Mini-Game** *(only if player’s skill < job requirement)*

   * 5 fast-paced math questions
   * All correct → complete the job successfully
   * Any wrong → fail the job (+3 stress, no income)

4. **Job Completion & Payout Calculation**

### 💵 Payout Formula

```js
quality = (QA / 10) * (Main Skill / Job Requirement)
quality = clamp(quality, 0, 1)
final_pay = quality * max_pay * pc_bonus
```

### 🎁 Bonus Triggers

| Bonus Type       | Trigger                           | Bonus Amount  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Critical Success | quality === 1.0                   | +\$25         |
| Client Tip       | quality === 1.0 and QA ≥ 9.0      | +\$50         |
| Partial Payment  | quality < 0.4 (but job completed) | 50% of payout |
| Failure          | Mini-game failed                  | No pay        |

5. **Stress Update**

   * +1 after successful job
   * +3 after any job failure
   * Max stress = 10 → Game Over
   * 3 days without taking a job → random skill -0.1

6. **Daily Action Limit**

   * Only 1 action allowed per day:

     * Accept a job
     * Take a course
     * Upgrade PC
     * Perform stress relief
